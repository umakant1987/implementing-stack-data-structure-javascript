================================


Stacks are data structures that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last item inserted into a stack is the first one to be deleted.


## Operations that we are going to implement:

- Push => Add an element to the stack.
- Pop => Delete an element from the stack.
- Peek => Get the top element of the stack.
- Length => Return the length of the stack.
- IsEmpty => Check if the stack is empty.
